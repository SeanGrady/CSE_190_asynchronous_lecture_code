# CSE_190_asynchronous_lecture_code
This is a repository intended for teaching students the basics of asynchronous programming via the ROS robotics framework.

The idea is to live-code a simple pub-sub 'robot' in an intuitive and synchronous way, and then demonstrate the reasons that you might not want this thing. Then live-code an asynchronus version of the code and demonstrate the advantages.

Live coding the examples provides an opportunity to explain asynchronous programming in a hands-on way, and the completed examples are provided in case I radically screw something up during the lecture.
